/// ACCT-02 — Personal Information, on seam 70 (SL-5).
///
/// A rider must be able to SEE what we hold about them. That is a transparency
/// obligation, not a nicety. But there is no `GET /me/profile` and no
/// `PATCH /me/profile` — there never has been — so they must never be led to
/// believe they can change any of it here.
///
/// The screen therefore does three things and nothing else:
///
/// 1. It CONSTRUCTS [PersonalInfoUnavailable] **unconditionally**, at the top.
///    The seam is not "sometimes null"; it is ALWAYS null. There is no branch
///    to hang the disclosure on and pretending there is one would be theatre.
/// 2. It renders the four facts the session genuinely carries — and omits any
///    row it does not know, rather than filling it with a placeholder.
/// 3. It shows the Save button the Figma promises, VISIBLE and at full size,
///    with `onPressed: null`.
///
/// 🔴 On (3): an empty callback is a lie; a null one is the truth. The parent
/// of this very screen (`profile_screen.dart:261`) coalesced a null tap handler
/// into an empty closure — five dead rows that gave a full tap ripple over
/// silence. The rider tapped, the UI acknowledged, nothing happened. Wave 0
/// caught it. A disabled control the rider can SEE is off is the honest form.
///
/// 🔴 What this screen refuses to draw, against the Figma frame:
/// - **A City row** — no such field exists ANYWHERE. Not in the JWT, not in the
///   session, not in DOCS/04, not in any endpoint. The city in the design is a
///   fabrication.
/// - **A photo picker** — there is no avatar endpoint. A picker would let a
///   rider select a photo that goes nowhere.
/// - **The Figma's placeholder rider name** — Wave 0 already deleted that
///   literal once, from the hub, where every real rider saw it.
/// - **An enabled Save** — there is nothing to save it to.
///
/// There is no interactor. This screen has nothing to do. That is the point.
