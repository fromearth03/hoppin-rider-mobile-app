/// The Hoppin modal sheet surface: top radius `radii.sheet`, FROSTED GLASS, a
/// centered 36x4 hairline drag handle, and the one ambient veil the surface
/// language allows — a single drawn [BoxShadow] beneath it.
///
/// 🔴 **It is glass, and it is glass at the SHEET tier** ([HopGlassTier.sheet]),
/// not the chrome tier the bars use. A sheet carries mid-emphasis body copy that
/// someone actually reads; the chrome's 72% fill measures 3.94:1 for dark
/// secondary text over the worst backdrop a sheet floats above, which is under
/// AA. The denser fill is the floor's decision, not a taste one — see
/// [HoppinColors.glassSheet].
///
/// The blur has something to sample because a modal route paints OVER the page:
/// the sheet floats above the scrim, which floats above the live screen. That is
/// the same layering bargain the shell makes, handed to us for free by the
/// navigator — which is exactly why a sheet is the right second home for this
/// material and a `Column`-stacked panel would not be.
///
/// Use [HopSheet.show] to present it modally over the scrim; the widget is
/// also embeddable directly for persistent bottom surfaces.
